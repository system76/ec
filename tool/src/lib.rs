#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

//! Library for accessing System76 ECs
//! First, construct an access method, using an object implementing the `Access` trait. Next, an Ec
//! object can be contructed, which exposes the command interface.
//!
//! There are some differences between targets and features that are listed below:
//!  - `AccessHid` requires the `hidapi` feature. Only functional on USB ECs.
//!  - `AccessLpcDirect` requires the `redox_hwio` feature and a nightly compiler. This method is
//!    only recommended for use in firmware with LPC ECs, as mutual exclusion is not guaranteed.
//!  - `AccessLpcLinux` requires the `std` feature and `linux` target_os. Recommended for LPC ECs,
//!    as this method can utilize mutual exclusion.
//!  - `EcLegacy`, `Pmc`, and `SuperIo` all require the `redox_hwio` feature and a nightly
//!    compiler. It is only recommended to use these in firmware, as mutual exclusion is not
//!    guaranteed.
