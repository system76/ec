System76 EC is a GPLv3 licensed embedded controller firmware for System76
laptops.

## Documentation

- [Supported embedded controllers](./docs/controllers.md)
- [Flashing firmware](./docs/flashing.md)
- [Debugging](./docs/debugging.md)
- [Creating a custom keyboard layout](./docs/keyboard-layout-customization.md)

## Quickstart

Install dependencies using the provided script.

```sh
./scripts/deps.sh
```

If rustup was installed as part of this, then the correct `cargo` will not be
available in the running session. Start a new shell session or source the env
file to update `PATH`.

```sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Then build the firmware for your laptop model.

```sh
make BOARD=system76/<model>
```

See [Flashing](./docs/flashing.md) for how to use the new firmware image.

## Releases

The EC firmware itself does not have tagged releases. Any commit of this repo
may be used as a part of a [System76 Open Firmware][firmware-open] release.

In official releases the EC shares the same version as the BIOS firmware. Run
the follow command from firmware-open to determine the corresponding EC commit
for a release.

```
git ls-tree <release_hash> ec
```

the register information is the same as IT8587/IT5570.)
